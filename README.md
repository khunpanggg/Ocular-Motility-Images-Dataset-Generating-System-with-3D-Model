# Ocular-Motility-Images-Dataset-Generating-System-with-3D-Model-for-Deep-Learning
### ABSTRACT
The main objective of this work is to develop a system to create an image dataset of ocular motility from 3d model to obtain a visual of ocular motility. This novel dataset will mitigate the limitation number of available image data and the avoidance of using patients images. By using our system, the user can define 1) normal or abnormal conditions of each extraocular muscle and 2) number of pictures. From these conditions, the system will automatically create an animation simulating the movements of the extraocular muscles and render the final images. After rendering, we will take an image dataset of ocular motility to learn, test and evaluate by using Convolution Neural Network Architecture (CNN) for analytics and classify the category of data into 2 main classes which names, 1) normal data of extraocular muscle and 2) abnormal data of extraocular muscle.
